    "### Question 10\n",
    "![Question 10](images/MCQuestion10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer: I and II only\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: II only\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "Choice I will return the correct value if the element in the array with one element was target. In this case, with the first call to seqSearchRecHelper the value of data[0] would be target and 0 would be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice I will return the correct value if the element in the array with one element was target. In this case, with the first call to seqSearchRecHelper the value of data[0] would be target and 0 would be returned. Choice II will eventually cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown when the recursive call is made with target and -1. This will happen after every valid index in data has been examined. During this call, data[-1] is out of bounds. Choice III will correctly return the index of the element closest to the end of the array with the value target, since data[last] == target will be true at some valid index value of last.\n",

    "### Question 11\n",
    "![Question 11](images/MCQuestion11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer: if (last <= 0)\n",
    "             return -1;\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: if (last < 0)\n",
    "                  return -1;\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "This will prevent an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException from being thrown if target does not appear in data, however if target is at element 0, -1 will be returned instead of 0 as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seqSearchRecHelper recursive method does not work as intended when target does not appear in data. In this case, when last becomes -1, the method will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in the first if statement after line 1. To prevent this, we should add a check to see if last is less than 0 and if it is, return -1 as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "My issue with problems 10 and 11 (which were connected) is that I was not familiar with how recursion works. I did not realize that with recursion, it travels down and then back up the granted call stack. This confused me, but I watched a a lesson on topic 10.1 (skill 5.A) to heighten my knowledge\n",

    "### Question 16\n",
    "![Question 16 ](images/MCQuestion16.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer: k + a1.length + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: k + a1.length\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "This will cause the value of result[a1.length] to remain 0,the default initial value for elements in an array of type int. Additionally, when k has the value a2.length – 1, the program will attempt to access the element result[a2.length – 1  + a1.length + 1] or result[a2.length + a1.length] and an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException will be thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first for loop, all the values from a1 are copied over to result at corresponding indices. At this point, the elements at index 0 through a1.length – 1 are full. The first index where the first element of a2 should be copied into is a1.length. We can use the loop control variable k to access all the elements in a2 and k + a1.length to access the corresponding elements in result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first for loop runs until j is equal to the value of a1.length. This means the result has no value (or the value 0) at a1.length. The next value in the new array would have to be a1.length, as that occurs in the next for loop, when k = 0. Therefore, the missing index should be k + a1.length, as adding 1 would leave an empty space in result. \n",

    "### Question 20\n",
    "![Question 20](images/MCQuestion20.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer: The array nums is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: The contents of the array nums are reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the while loop terminates when j is greater than or equal to k, the first half of the elements in nums are swapped with the second half of the elements in nums. If the while condition was changed to j < nums.length, then all the elements would be swapped and then swapped back to their original location and nums would be unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable j starts with the value 0, which is the index of the left most element in nums. The variable k starts with the value nums.length – 1, which is the index of the right most element in nums. As long as j is less than k, x is assigned the value of nums[j], this ensures that the value of nums[j] is not lost when nums[j] is assigned the value of nums[k]. Then nums[k] is assigned the value of x. This algorithm swaps the values of nums[j] and nums[k]. Then j is incremented and k is decremented, ensuring that the contents of the array nums are reversed at the conclusion of the arrayMethod method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, I did not understand what was going on with the assigning of each variable. After careful consideration, it now makes sense to me that the values of nums[j] and nums[k] are switched. This is because arrayMethod sets x to be assigned as the value of nums[j], sets nums[j] to be assigned the value of nums[k], and sets nums[k] to be assigned the value of x.\n",

    "### Question 24\n",
    "![Question 24](images/MCQuestion24.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: 7\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "\n",
    "The row and column indices for 2D arrays start at 0. The value 4 is at newArray[0][1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The enhanced for loop iterates over the array oldArray. In the first iteration, newArray[0][0] is assigned the value 1. The value of row is incremented to 1. Since 1 % 3 does not equal 0, the statements in the if are not executed. In the next iteration, newArray[1][0] is assigned the value 2. The value of row is incremented to 2. The algorithm continues to fill column 0 with the subsequent values of oldArray. Once row is 3, the if condition is true and row is assigned 0 and col is incremented to 1. The algorithm proceeds to fill column 1. When the for loop terminates, newArray contains the following values { {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8}, {3, 6, 9} }. The value of newArray[0][2] is 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, I did not really understand how the 2d array was functioning. Only after seeing the answer, I understood that the new array was being printed by column, with row increasing each time. Once the row number was a factor of 3, the column increased by one and row was reset back to zero. (newArray [0] [2]) represents the value in row zero, column 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 28\n",
    "![Question 28](images/MCQuestion28.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer: n will sometimes be greater than 2 at // Point C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: n will always be greater than 2 at // Point B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "At //Point C, n will be 2 or less, since when n is greater than 2, the while loop iterates decrementing n until it has the value 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop only iterates while n is greater than 2 and //Point B is in the body of the while loop prior to any change to the value of n. At this point, n will always be greater than 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "My mistake came from my misunderstanding of while loops. While it seems obvious, I overlooked that the while loop iterates repeatedly as long as the condition is met. Because point c is outside and after the while loop, point c will only receive n values that do not meet the while loop condition. Because point b is inside the while loop, it will only receive n values that meet the condition of the while loop.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 39\n",
    "![Question 39](images/MCQuestion39.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer: 18\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: 16\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of recur(9) is 18. However, this call was made within another recursive call and is not the final return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The call recur(27) returns the value of recur(recur(9)) since 27 is greater than 10. The call recur(9) returns 18, since 9 is less than or equal to 10. Therefore, recur(recur(9)) is recur(18). The call recur(18) returns recur(recur(6)) since 18 is greater than 10. The call recur(6) returns 12, since 6 is less than or equal to 10. Therefore, recur(recur(6)) is recur(12). The call recur(12) returns recur(recur(4)) since 12 is greater than 10. The call recur(4) returns 8, since 4 is less than or equal to 10. Therefore, recur(recur(4)) is recur(8). The call recur(8) returns 16, since 8 is less than or equal to 10.  Therefore, recur(27)returns the value of 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "My error here was that I failed to recognize the double recur, which takes the output of 18 and then recurs it once again, making 18 not the final output. I failed to realize that 'recur recur (n/3)' takes the output of 'recur (n/3)' and plugs it back into the recur value. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "While taking the college board mcq, I found myself wondering what the difference between .length and .size were. I learned that .length provides the length of an array or array object, which is the total space allocated in memory during the initialization of the array. .size, on the other hand, provides the total number of objects in the collection of an arraylist, which has no length property to provide. I also learned that both .length and .size start counting at 1, rather than the zero.\n",
