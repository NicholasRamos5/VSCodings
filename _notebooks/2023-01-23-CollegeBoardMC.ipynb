    "Reason why incorrect:\n",
    "\n",
    "The enhanced for loop in line 8\n",
    " is intended to traverse the rows of the two-dimensional array arr. Each row of arr is a one-dimensional array of int values, int[] row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: \n",
    "![Alt text](images/CBMCQ16Correct.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-dimensional arrays are stored as arrays of one-dimensional arrays. Line 8\n",
    " is intended to assign to row, a one-dimensional array of int values, a single row of the two-dimensional array arr. The original version of line 8\n",
    " attempts to assign a row of col, but col is not a two-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 17:\n",
    "![Alt text](images/CBMCQ17.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer:\n",
    "![Alt text](images/CBMCQ17False.png)\n",

    "This would result from incrementing counter when \"a\" is not followed by \"b\" and not followed by a space. This occurs three times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer:\n",
    "![Alt text](images/CBMCQ17Correct.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason: \n",
    "\n",
    "The expression str.substring(i, i + 1).equals(\"a\") will evaluate to true if str contains the string \"a\" at position i. The expression !str.substring(i + 1, i + 2) will evaluate to true if str does not contain the string \"b\" at position i + 1. The variable counter is incremented when both of those expressions evaluate to true or, in other words, whenever \"a\" is not immediately followed by \"b\". This occurs five times in the given string: \"a \", \"ac\", \"at\", \"at\", and \"a \".\n",

    "### Question 22:\n",

    "\n",
    "Reason why incorrect:\n",
    "\n",
    "The method works as intended when the last element in all the columns of the two-dimensional input array does not contain the string \"a\". That is the case for this option, so the method will appear to work as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: \n",
    "![Alt text](images/CBMCQ22Correct.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "The count method contains two for loops. The outer for loop will iterate through each row in the things array. The inner for loop will iterate through all but the last element in each column. Therefore, if the last element in any column of the two-dimensional input array contains the string \"a\", the total count will be incorrect. That is the case for this option, so the method will not work as intended. The Boolean expression in the inner for loop should be c < things[r].length instead of c < things[r].length - 1.\n",

    "![Alt text](images/CBMCQ23False.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason why incorrect: \n",

    "Making this change will cause the method to not check the last element in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: \n",
    "![Alt text](images/CBMCQ23Correct.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "The last array element is at index arr.length - 1, so the loop should only iterate while j < arr.length.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reason why incorrect:\n",
    "\n",
    "The original code segment prints 10. This code segment prints 11 because the loop executes 11 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: \n",
    "![Alt text](images/CBMCQ35Correct.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop iterates 10 times. In each iteration, count is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of count is 0, the printed value of count is 10.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reason: \n",
    "\n",
    "In option I, \"W\" is not printed because the expression a < b evaluates to false. In option II, \"W\" is not printed because the expression a > 0 evaluates to false. In option III, both a < b and a > 0 evaluate to true, so \"W\" is printed.\n",

    "- 4C: Determine if two or more code segments yield equivalent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I failed to do well in cases where I needed to figure out errors in code or results. There were also other problems that fell into this category that I was stuck on but got correct. However, I feel that I did exceptionally well when it came to boolean statements, if statements, and de morgan's law. I think I know and understand college board unit three pretty well. However, I should review units 4 and 5 in the near future, in order to better my understandings of the content I will be tested on.  "
